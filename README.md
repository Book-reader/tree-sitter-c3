# tree-sitter-c3
This is a complete implementation of the current C3 grammar for tree-sitter, usable for syntax highlighting, indentation, folding, code analysis, header/doc generation, and more.

The latest version supports C3 0.6.1 and is not compatible with C3 < 0.6.0.

Note that tree structure and node naming is still subject to change.
