# tree-sitter-c3
This is a complete implementation of the current C3 grammar for tree-sitter, usable for syntax highlighting, indentation, folding, code analysis, header/doc generation, and more.

The latest version supports C3 0.6.1 and is not compatible with C3 < 0.6.0.

_Check out the tree-sitter playground here:_ https://c3lang.github.io/tree-sitter-c3/

### Notes
- This is in some cases a less strict version of the "true" grammar.
- Tree structure and node naming is still subject to change.
